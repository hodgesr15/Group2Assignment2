        <p>I attended Pine Forest High School while living in Spring Lake. The School is located in Fayetteville NC and has very good I.T. teachers. While in Highschool I did not play any organized sports, but I was very active around my house and in the neighborhood. I still continued to look for safe fun, and also enjoyed the bus rides to school with my friends. The picture above is a stick man me and my friend made when we found sticky notes on the bus.</p>

        <p>After highschool I decided to attend East Carolina University in Greenville North Carolina. I ended up meeting up with some of my best friends, and really enjoying this part of life. I am a senior who is majoring in Information Computer Technology, and I also play many sports. If I am not doing any school related things I am either playing a sport, or hanging out with some friends. This is my second year as the President of the ECU Boxing club, and the boxing club has become like a second family. My sophomore year at ECU I was lucky enough to get into the Cisco Calo co-op program. I really enjoyed this Co-op. Not only did I learn and gain valuable experience in my feild, but I meet new friends. </p>
